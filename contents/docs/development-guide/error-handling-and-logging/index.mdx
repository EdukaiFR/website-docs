# Error Handling and Logging

## Introduction

Error handling and logging are essential for building robust and maintainable frontend applications. They help identify, debug, and address issues effectively. In this project, built with **Next.js**, **TailwindCSS**, and **TypeScript**, proper error handling and structured logging can ensure a smoother development process and a better user experience.

## Error Handling

### Types of Errors

1. **Client-Side Errors**: Errors occurring in the browser, often due to invalid user input or code issues.
2. **Server-Side Errors**: Errors originating from backend services, such as API failures or database issues.
3. **Network Errors**: Errors caused by failed requests, slow connections, or timeouts.

### Handling Errors in Next.js

#### Error Boundaries

Use React error boundaries to catch JavaScript errors in components.

**Example:**

```typescript
import React from "react";

class ErrorBoundary extends React.Component {
  state = { hasError: false };

  static getDerivedStateFromError() {
    return { hasError: true };
  }

  componentDidCatch(error: Error, info: React.ErrorInfo) {
    console.error("Error caught by boundary:", error, info);
  }

  render() {
    if (this.state.hasError) {
      return <h1>Something went wrong.</h1>;
    }
    return this.props.children;
  }
}

export default ErrorBoundary;
```

Wrap critical components with the `ErrorBoundary` component:

```typescript
<ErrorBoundary>
  <MyComponent />
</ErrorBoundary>
```

---

#### Custom Error Pages

Create a custom `_error.js` file in the `pages` directory to handle errors globally.

**Example:**

```typescript
import React from "react";

function CustomError({ statusCode }: { statusCode?: number }) {
  return (
    <p>
      {statusCode
        ? `An error ${statusCode} occurred on the server`
        : "An error occurred on the client"}
    </p>
  );
}

CustomError.getInitialProps = ({ res, err }: any) => {
  const statusCode = res ? res.statusCode : err ? err.statusCode : 404;
  return { statusCode };
};

export default CustomError;
```

---

#### Handling API Errors

Catch and handle errors when making API calls.

**Example:**

```typescript
async function fetchData(url: string) {
  try {
    const response = await fetch(url);
    if (!response.ok) {
      throw new Error(`HTTP error! Status: ${response.status}`);
    }
    return await response.json();
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("API call failed:", error);
    throw error;
  }
}
```

## Logging

### Why Logging is Important

Logging provides visibility into application behavior, helping developers identify and debug issues efficiently.

---

### Tools for Logging

1. **Console Logging**: Use `console.log`, `console.warn`, and `console.error` during development. Remove or minimize these in production.
2. **Logging Libraries**: Use libraries like `winston` or `pino` for structured logging.

---

### Logging in Next.js

Use `next-logger` for a simple logging setup in a Next.js project.

#### Installation

```bash
npm install next-logger
```

#### Basic Usage

```typescript
import logger from "next-logger";

logger.info("This is an info message");
logger.error("This is an error message");
```

---

### Structured Logging with `debug`

Install the `debug` library:

```bash
npm install debug
```

Use it in your project:

```typescript
import debug from "debug";

const log = debug("app:component");
log("This is a debug message");
```

Enable debug logs in development:

```bash
DEBUG=app:* npm run dev
```

---

## Monitoring Tools

### Sentry

Sentry is a popular error tracking and monitoring tool.

#### Installation

```bash
npm install @sentry/nextjs
```

#### Configuration

Add the following to `sentry.server.config.js` and `sentry.client.config.js`:

```typescript
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/nextjs";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "your-dsn-url",
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
});
```

---

### LogRocket

LogRocket captures logs, errors, and user sessions for advanced debugging.

#### Installation

```bash
npm install logrocket
```

#### Usage

```typescript
import LogRocket from "logrocket";

LogRocket.init("your-app-id");
```

## Best Practices for Error Handling and Logging

1. Catch and handle errors gracefully without exposing sensitive information to users.
2. Use structured logging to provide context about errors.
3. Monitor logs and errors in real-time using tools like Sentry or LogRocket.
4. Use error boundaries to prevent the app from crashing due to unexpected errors.
5. Regularly review and improve logging practices as the application evolves.

With effective error handling and logging, you can build a more resilient and maintainable Next.js application. Always strive for meaningful logs and robust error management. Happy coding!
