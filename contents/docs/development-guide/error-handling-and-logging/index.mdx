# Error Handling and Logging

## Managing Errors in API Routes and UI

Wrap API routes in try-catch blocks to handle errors gracefully. Provide feedback in the UI using error messages.

## Setting Up Logging and Monitoring

- Use `console.error` for development errors.
- In production, consider using services like Sentry for error logging and monitoring.
