# Working with Environment Variables

## Setting Up Environment Variables

Environment variables can be stored in a `.env.local` file. Define each variable with `NEXT_PUBLIC` prefix for client-side usage.

## Ensuring Security with Sensitive Data

- Never commit `.env.local` to the repository.
- Use Vercel to set production environment variables.
