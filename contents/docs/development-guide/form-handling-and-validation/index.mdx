# Form Handling and Validation

## Implementing Form Submissions

1. Use controlled components to handle form input.
2. On form submission, prevent the default behavior and handle data processing.

## Using Libraries for Form Validation

Libraries like `react-hook-form` and `Yup` can handle validation with minimal setup. This helps in validating user input before submission.
