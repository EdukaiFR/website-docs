# Creating Customizable Components

## Guide on Building Reusable Components

Reusable components are key to building a scalable and maintainable project. A reusable component can be used across multiple pages with different data and configurations, allowing for a more modular and efficient codebase.

### Steps to Create a Reusable Component

1. **Define the Component Structure**  
   Start by defining a basic component structure in `.tsx` format, taking advantage of TypeScript for type-checking. This structure should include any props that the component may receive, allowing for flexible data passing.

2. **Use Props to Pass Data**  
   Props make it possible to customize each instance of a component with different data. Define clear and descriptive types for props using TypeScript, which helps with type safety and enhances developer experience by providing autocompletion.

3. **Place Components in a `components` Directory**  
   To keep your project organized, create a `components` folder at the root level (or within specific route folders for route-specific components). Group reusable components together, making them easy to locate and maintain.

4. **Write Comprehensive Documentation**  
   Add clear documentation within the component file. Use comments to describe each prop, including its type and purpose. This documentation will help other developers understand the component's functionality and intended usage quickly.

### Example: A Button Component

Here's an example of a basic, reusable Button component:

```tsx
// components/Button.tsx

import React from "react";

type ButtonProps = {
  label: string; // The text displayed on the button
  onClick: () => void; // Function to handle button click events
  disabled?: boolean; // Optionally disables the button
  variant?: "primary" | "secondary"; // Style variants for different button types
};

/**
 * A customizable button component.
 *
 * Props:
 * - `label` (string): The text displayed on the button.
 * - `onClick` (function): The callback function when the button is clicked.
 * - `disabled` (boolean, optional): Whether the button is disabled.
 * - `variant` (string, optional): The style variant for the button, default is 'primary'.
 */
const Button: React.FC<ButtonProps> = ({
  label,
  onClick,
  disabled = false,
  variant = "primary",
}) => {
  const buttonStyle = variant === "primary" ? "btn-primary" : "btn-secondary";

  return (
    <button className={buttonStyle} onClick={onClick} disabled={disabled}>
      {label}
    </button>
  );
};

export default Button;
```

### Tips for Building Customizable Components

- **Use Default Props**
  Default props provide a predictable behavior when a prop is not supplied by the parent component. For example, setting `disabled = false` in the `Button` component ensures it will be enabled by default.

- **Design with Flexibility in Mind**
  Consider how the component might be used in different parts of the application. For example, if you’re building a card component, you might include optional props for images, titles, descriptions, and buttons.

- **Limit Component Complexity**
  If a component begins to have too many props, consider breaking it down into smaller subcomponents. Complex components can become difficult to manage and understand.

### Using Props for Flexibility

Props enable components to be dynamic and adaptable. By passing data through props, you allow each instance of a component to vary without duplicating code. Here are some best practices for using props effectively:

- **Document Each Prop's Purpose**
  Within the component file, add comments for each prop explaining its type, purpose, and any default values. This documentation serves as an immediate reference for developers.

- **Utilize TypeScript for Strong Typing**
  Define prop types explicitly using TypeScript. This prevents potential runtime errors and improves code readability. Type-checking also allows IDEs to provide helpful autocompletions and warnings.

- **Avoid Passing Excessive Props**
  Keep the prop list concise and focused. If a component requires too many props, it may be too complex and should be split into smaller, more manageable components.

- **Use Conditional Rendering for Optional Elements**
  If a prop controls the visibility or inclusion of certain elements, apply conditional rendering to ensure these elements only appear when necessary. For example, display a `subtitle` in a card component only if the subtitle prop is provided.

### Example with Conditional Rendering and Default Props

In the example below, an optional `subtitle` prop is used. The component will display the subtitle only if it’s provided.

```tsx
// components/Card.tsx

type CardProps = {
  title: string;
  subtitle?: string;
  content: string;
};

/**
 * A card component with an optional subtitle.
 *
 * Props:
 * - `title` (string): The main title of the card.
 * - `subtitle` (string, optional): An optional subtitle for the card.
 * - `content` (string): The main content of the card.
 */
const Card: React.FC<CardProps> = ({ title, subtitle, content }) => {
  return (
    <div className="card">
      <h2>{title}</h2>
      {subtitle && <h3>{subtitle}</h3>} {/* Render subtitle only if provided */}
      <p>{content}</p>
    </div>
  );
};

export default Card;
```

### Additional Best Practices

- **Use CSS Modules or Tailwind for Styling**
  For styling reusable components, consider using CSS Modules, which offer scoped CSS to avoid class conflicts. Alternatively, Tailwind CSS can be a flexible and efficient styling solution for reusable components.

- **Keep Components Pure**
  A "pure" component is one that does not have side effects and always renders the same output for the same input. This ensures that your components are predictable and reusable across different parts of your application.

- **Avoid Inline Styles**
  Inline styles can make components less reusable and harder to maintain. Instead, prefer classes defined in CSS or use a utility-based CSS framework like Tailwind to manage styles more efficiently.

- **Testing**
  Consider writing tests for your reusable components to ensure they work as expected with different sets of props. This can help prevent regressions as the component evolves over time.

By following these practices, you’ll create components that are adaptable, easy to understand, and reusable across your Next.js project.
