# Setting Up API Routes

## Creating Serverless API Routes in Next.js

Next.js allows you to create serverless API routes easily by adding files to the `pages/api` directory (for older versions) or under the `app/api` folder when using the App Router. Each file in these directories corresponds to an endpoint.

For example:

- A file `app/api/hello/route.ts` creates an endpoint accessible at `/api/hello`.

API routes are ideal for handling requests such as form submissions, fetching data, or interacting with external APIs, all within the Next.js app. Below is an example of a custom API route using Nodemailer to send emails.

### Example: Sending Email Using `nodemailer`

Here’s an example API route (`app/api/sendMail/route.ts`) to handle email sending. This API takes form input from a request body, such as sender email, name, and message content, and sends it using Gmail’s SMTP server. This example uses `nodemailer` for handling email transport.

```typescript
// app/api/sendMail/route.ts

import { NextRequest } from "next/server";
import nodemailer from "nodemailer";

const transporter = nodemailer.createTransport({
  host: "smtp.gmail.com",
  port: 587,
  secure: false,
  auth: {
    user: process.env.MailAdress, // Sender email address
    pass: process.env.MailPassword, // Password from environment variables for security
  },
});

export async function POST(req: NextRequest) {
  const res = await req.json(); // Parsing JSON body data

  try {
    await transporter.sendMail({
      from: res.email,
      to: "tristan.hourtoulle@epitech.eu",
      subject: `New message from ${res.name}: ${res.subject}`,
      text: res.message,
      html: `<p>${res.message}</p>`,
    });

    return Response.json(
      { success: true, message: "Email sent successfully" },
      { status: 200 }
    );
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error sending email:", error);
    return Response.json(
      { success: false, message: "Failed to send email" },
      { status: 500 }
    );
  }
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Import and Configure `nodemailer`**
   `nodemailer` is used to handle email sending. The configuration includes setting up an SMTP transporter using Gmail’s SMTP server and credentials stored in environment variables.

2. **Extract Request Data**
   The `POST` method reads data from the request body, which is expected to be JSON containing fields like `email`, `name`, `subject`, and `message`.

3. **Sending the Email**
   `transporter.sendMail` sends the email with the received details. The email is sent to a specific address `(tristan.hourtoulle@epitech.eu)` and includes the sender’s name, subject, and message.

4. **Error Handling**
   If the email fails to send, the API logs the error and returns a `500` status with an error message. Otherwise, it returns a success response with a `200` status.

### Secure API Handling and Error Management

Securing and properly managing API routes is essential for protecting data and ensuring reliable application behavior.

### Best Practices for Secure and Reliable API Routes

1. **Environment Variables for Sensitive Data**
   Store sensitive information, like email addresses and passwords, in environment variables (e.g., `.env.local` file) instead of hardcoding them. In the above example, `process.env.MailAdress` and `process.env.MailPassword` are used to keep email credentials secure.

2. **Validate Input Data**
   Always validate incoming data to protect your API from invalid or malicious data. For instance, before sending the email, you might check that the `email`, `name`, `subject`, and `message` fields are correctly formatted and not empty.

Example validation:

Example validation:

```typescript
if (!res.email || !res.message || !res.name || !res.subject) {
  return Response.json(
    { success: false, message: "Required fields are missing" },
    { status: 400 }
  );
}
```

3. **Error Handling**
   Handle errors gracefully by catching them and returning meaningful messages. This helps in debugging and improves the user experience by informing users when something goes wrong. Use `try...catch` blocks around asynchronous operations like `sendMail` to capture and log any errors.

4. **Rate Limiting and Throttling**
   To prevent abuse, consider implementing rate limiting on your API routes, especially for sensitive endpoints like email sending. Libraries like `express-rate-limit` can help with rate limiting in a Node.js environment, or you can use middleware solutions that integrate with Next.js.

5. **Use Secure Headers**
   Apply security headers like `Content-Security-Policy`, `X-Content-Type-Options`, and `X-Frame-Option`s to protect your API routes from common attacks, such as XSS and clickjacking. Next.js provides some of these by default, but they can be customized in your configuration.

6. **Logging and Monitoring**
   Implement logging for important actions, especially for error cases. This helps in identifying issues quickly in production environments.

### Example Enhanced Error Handling

Here’s how we might add extra validation to the email API route to check for required fields and add more detailed error responses.

```typescript
export async function POST(req: NextRequest) {
  const res = await req.json();

  // Input validation
  if (!res.email || !res.message || !res.name || !res.subject) {
    return Response.json(
      { success: false, message: "Please provide all required fields." },
      { status: 400 }
    );
  }

  try {
    await transporter.sendMail({
      from: res.email,
      to: "tristan.hourtoulle@epitech.eu",
      subject: `New message from ${res.name}: ${res.subject}`,
      text: res.message,
      html: `<p>${res.message}</p>`,
    });

    return Response.json(
      { success: true, message: "Email sent successfully" },
      { status: 200 }
    );
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error sending email:", error);
    if (error instanceof SomeSpecificError) {
      return Response.json(
        { success: false, message: "Detailed error message for the user." },
        { status: 500 }
      );
    }
    return Response.json(
      { success: false, message: "Failed to send email" },
      { status: 500 }
    );
  }
}
```
