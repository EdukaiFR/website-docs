# Installation

This section covers the steps to set up the Edukai Website project on your local environment. Follow the instructions below to get started.

## Prerequisites

Before installing, ensure you have the following tools installed:

- **Node.js** (v16 or later)
- **Git** (latest version)

## Steps

### 1. Clone the Repository

Start by cloning the repository from GitHub:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/EdukaiFR/website.git
cd website
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

After navigating to the project directory, install the necessary dependencies using your package manager:

```bash
# Using npm
npm install

# Using pnpm
pnpm install

# Using yarn
yarn install
```

### 3. Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory, based on the `.env.example` file provided in the repository. This file contains essential environment variables, such as API keys and authentication credentials.

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

Then, open `.env.local` and replace placeholder values with actual configurations for your local setup.

### 4. Start the Development Server

Once the dependencies are installed and environment variables are configured, start the development server:

```bash
# Using npm
npm run dev

# Using pnpm
pnpm dev

# Using yarn
yarn dev
```

The project will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000` by default.

### Additional Notes

- **Build for Production**: To create an optimized production build, run npm run build, yarn build, or pnpm build.
- **Testing the Installation**: Ensure the server is running smoothly by navigating to the URL provided. Verify functionality to confirm installation success.
